<h1>Saving nature is important. It save wildlife, plants, tree's, and newborn animals.</h1>
<p>Have you ever seen a tree be cut down? Or seen that you see flowers dying quickly? That's because we have been treating nature 
wrongly. We have been throwing our trashin the woods like plastic, bottles, and more that are harning the wild life. Trees produce 
oxygen, while flowers and bugs help each other make more flowers because flowershold pollen. Pollen makes more flowers by bees and 
other insects carring the pollen.If we help nature,nature can help us with things like shelter, food, and more! If we care about nature, 
we also help... animals! Animals need nature too! Animals need them for the same things! Shelter and food, water and more! They also need
 space for... newborns! Newborns also need the things their parents need. We are here for nature, and nature is here for us.</p>
