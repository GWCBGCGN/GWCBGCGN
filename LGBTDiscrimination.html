<h1><b>What is the LGBT+ Community?</b></h1>
<p> The LGBT+ Community is a community that either supports or are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and people along those lines. </p>
<h1><b>What do those mean?</b></h1>
<p>Lesbian-Females being attracted to other females</p>
<p>Gay-Males being attracted to males</p>
<p>Bisexual-Either gender being attracted to males and females</p>
<p>Transgender-Changing to the opposite gender</p>
<p>There are other things like this, like pansexual, genderfluid, ect. If you want to view all the the different LGBT+ classifications, go to the link below.</p>

<h1>Why is the LGBT+ community great?</h1>
<p>People in the LGBT+ are wrongfully discriminated against because of who they like and who they are. People who disagree with the LGBT+ community say it's because the Bible says "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22)". However, "And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. (Matthew 22:39)" is the first and greatest commandment. What if your neighbour happens to be gay? What then? Do you still love them or not?</p>
<p>There are other quotes about love, but there are too many to fit on this page.</p>

<h1>In Conclusion</h1>
<p>Just because someone likes people of the same gender, don't feel like the gender they were born with, or even don't feel like a gender at all, shouldn't be discriminated against because of it. Love and feelings about yourself isn't a choice. You were born the way you were, and you can't control it. If you were born with a disability, you can't control it. If you were born with a large birthmark on your face, not your problem.</p>
